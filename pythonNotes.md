**PYTHON INTRODUCTION**â€¨

**Python Collections (Arrays)**
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language

*TUPLES:*

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable and they allow duplicates values.
Tuples are written with round brackets.


```py
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
 print(mytuple)

#To check how many items are in this tuple use:
print(len(mytuple))


#To create a tuple with only one item(if you dont put the comma, python will think its a string)
thistuple = ("apple",) #add a comma
 print(type(thistuple)) #tuple 

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
tuple4 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")

........#Check if Item Exists:

if "apple" in tuple1:
 print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")

#Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple. 
tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(tuple1)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

#you can also add stuff
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)


#When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

#But, in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking":
(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

#Join two tuples:

tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)
```



*List:*

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.List Items, Ordered, Changeable and allow Duplicates.
```py
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
nums.reverse()
print(nums)

```

*Set:*

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed, no duplicates.
```py
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}


set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)
```

*Dictionary:*

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

```py
band={"Vocals":"plants",
       "Guitar":"page"}

       
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

#Nested dictionaries
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}
```
You can also write it like this:
```py
band2 = dict(vocals="plants", guitar ="page")
```





**PYTHON LAMBDA:**

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

*lambda arguments : expression*
