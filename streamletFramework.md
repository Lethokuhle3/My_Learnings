#Streamlit

when installing python .. When you run the installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

What I had to do :

Add this path to your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable:
Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties."
Click on "Advanced system settings."
Click on "Environment Variables."
In the "System variables" section, find the "Path" variable and select it, then click "Edit."
Click "New" and add the path to the Scripts folder.
Click OK to close all dialogs
