**Python virtual environments**


What is PIP?

PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like.


Third party packages- pip commands

```py
C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>pip --version
```

>Version conflicts happens when you have installed maybe Django version 3 for this project but another project doesn't use Django 3 it uses
Django4, so where that's when a conflict happens.. so the solution for all these problems is a virtual environments, separating your Python environments

>A virtual environment is an isolated environment that physically lives inside a folder that contains all the packages and dependencies

I tried with "where pip" to see where its installed which pip was not working
```py
mkdir my-python-project for creating a project

cd my-python-project

python3 -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>

ls to check the list BUT youâ€™re working in the Windows Command Pro ls is not recognised, you have to use dir and not ls

```
Import and use "camelcase":
```py
import camelcase

c = camelcase.CamelCase()

txt = "hello world"

print(c.hump(txt))
```
